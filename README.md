For my jobs that I want out of college, the way that I would gain the qualifications needed are many different ways.
One way I would hope to gain the qualifications would be through my degree that I get through Illinois State University. 
If that does not put me closer to the qualifications needed for the job then I am obviously looking for the wrong job. 
Also, if they came to me and told me there were certain classes they wanted me to take to further my knowledge for this class then I would without a doubt take those classes that they think are necessary. 
Another way that I would make sure that I gain the qualifications for the job would be to make sure that I have all the certificates and licenses needed to be qualified for the job. 
If I did not have all the certificates then I would take whatever classes and do whatever I need to so that I make sure that I have all of the certificates and licenses needed. 
I would pay the money for any classes and or licenses that I need to take and or apply for. 
When it comes to the jobs that I am looking at for the 5-8 year range I would hope that the job experience that I gain from my first jobs would help to qualify me to be able to have the next job in line for me. 
If there are any further certificate and or licenses I would again do all the steps necessary to get those. 
Also, for the 5-8 year jobs, I would look into getting my Doctorate degree in Networking from Illinois State University so that it would also further better the qualifications that I need for these jobs.  
I am mainly hoping that with my first job it will lead me into one of the 5-8 year jobs. 
On the job experience is sometimes some of the best experience and knowledge that you can gain so I really hope that the first job leads into the later jobs. 
Also, with some older jobs you may be sent to classes that will help you to further your education and expierence that you need for other jobs.
